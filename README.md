# Slider

You can either use the demo or set the app up on your computer

### Demo:

[Slider-app](tombslider.netlify.app)

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project folder in your code editor
3. Choose the 'slider' branch
4. Use the 'npm install' command in the console
5. Use 'npm start' command to launch the app
6. Use 'npm run build' to build the project

### Using the app:
add links to the images into the form and use the tools to view the images 
(example: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603996331944-dcb02c639178?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80)

### Tasks: 
#### Done:

* Setup the environment (including webpack or any other bundler configuration)
* Create a slider which works on mobile and desktop
* Make a useful readme - tell us how to set up your application

* Must work for mobile and desktop devices
* Must support swipes
 
* Supports multiple slides on the screen
* Supports infinite option
* Supports scrolling to a selected slide (like go to slide X) 

### My optimization: 

* Slider can work with any number of images. It doesn't matter if you load one or one million images, it will work well in any case.

### P.S.

I have a question about this task: 'Must work for any HTML content'. Should I make slider for any file type? 
If so I can re-make the app so it can work with any file types.
